Email Registration application.


================================================
Web app description
================================================

Tech stack:
 - Spring Boot
 - Angular Js
 - Hibernate

 Why Spring Boot?
 - it's widely used platform to solve of these requirements, easy to configure, start and test.

 Why AngularJS?
 - AngularJS is one of the popular framework for developing web application. For this application,
 it doesn't make any sense what should we use react or angular. I have experience with AngularJS.


Possible usages:

1) Event registration (education course, conference, meeting up or etc)
2) E-commerce (quick client feedback/callback form, e-shop newsletter registration form)
3) Account registration (after submit the form, email confirmation letter will be sent to proceed in registration process)
